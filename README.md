# Textbook for Excel

This is my textbook for an Excel class which I teach for the Center for Lifelong Learning at Cochise College in Arizona. The class is divided into three one-day sessions: Introduction to Excel, Intermediate Excel, and Advanced Excel. 

The first six chapters of this book are based on the following open-source book:

_Beginning Excel_ by Noreen Brown, Barbara Lave, Julie Romey, Mary Schatz, Diane Shingledecker. Found at [Open Oregon Educational Resources](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/beginningexcel/): https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/beginningexcel/.

I wrote the last three chapters myself in order to extend the Excel training available to my students into a few more advanced topics.

This book is published under the Creative Commons 4.0 "Attribution" license, so it can be changed and reused for other classes. It was written with _MikTex_ using _TexStudio_ and all source files are posted here so other instructors can create a personalized version for their own classes. Also posted is a PDF (_Excel.pdf_) which can be downloaded and used immediately if desired.
