# Textbook for Excel

This is my textbook for an Excel class which I teach for the Center for Lifelong Learning at Cochise College in Arizona. The class is divided into three one-day sessions: Introduction to Excel, Intermediate Excel, and Advanced Excel. 

This book is based on two open-source books:

_Beginning Excel_ by Noreen Brown, Barbara Lave, Julie Romey, Mary Schatz, Diane Shingledecker. Found at [Open Oregon Educational Resources](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/beginningexcel/): https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/beginningexcel/.

_How to Use Microsoft Excel: The Careers in Practice Series_, adapted by _The Saylor Foundation_ without attribution as requested by the work's original creator. It was downloaded from [https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/textbooks/How%20to%20Use%20Microsoft%20Excel.pdf](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/textbooks/How%20to%20Use%20Microsoft%20Excel.pdf)

This book is published under the Creative Commons 4.0 "Attribution" license, so it can be changed and reused for other classes. It was written with _MikTex_ using _TexStudio_ and all source files are posted here so other instructors can create a personalized version for their own classes. Also posted is a PDF (_Excel.pdf_) which can be downloaded and used immediately if desired.
